# AI Search Chat Application

This is a sample PDF document for testing the AI Search Chat application.

## Introduction

Welcome to the AI Search Chat application! This document serves as a test file to demonstrate the PDF processing and citation capabilities of the system.

## Key Features

The application includes the following capabilities:

1. **Real-time Streaming**: Responses are streamed token-by-token using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

2. **Document Search**: The system can search across multiple PDF documents to find relevant information.

3. **Citation Generation**: Answers include numbered citations [1], [2], [3] that reference specific pages in source documents.

4. **Generative UI**: The response can include dynamically generated UI components like tables, charts, and info cards.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components

The backend is built with:
- FastAPI for the REST API
- LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Redis Queue for async job processing
- pdfplumber for PDF text extraction

### Frontend Components

The frontend uses:
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Zustand for state management

## Sample Data

Here is some sample data that can be used for testing queries:

| Category | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Users | 1,000 | Active monthly users |
| Documents | 500 | PDFs in knowledge base |
| Queries | 10,000 | Average daily queries |
| Response Time | 2.5s | Average response time |

## Conclusion

This sample document demonstrates how the AI Search Chat application can process PDF content, extract relevant information, and present it with proper citations.
